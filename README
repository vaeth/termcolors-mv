256colors sample script, dircolors configuration files, and a dircolors wrapper

For gentoo, the package is available over the mv overlay (via layman).

This package contains two scripts and some "dircolors" colorschemes,
all appropriate for unix type terminals with 8/16 and 256 colors.

The dircolor colorschemes (in etc/dircolors) are appropriate for
8/16 colors or 256 colors, respectively, and they were developed
for standard system colors and Ethan Schoonover's solarized colorscheme,
respectively.

The system color schemes are developed for black background terminals, only.

The solarized versions work with both, light and dark versions of
the solarized colorscheme, and if you use them you are responsible on your
own to set the terminal colors so that the 8/16 system colors are mapped
to the colors from the solarized scheme.
The 256-color solarized scheme adds some more colors to the original scheme
to allow a richer distinction of files.

To use the color schemes you can call
	eval "`dircolors [path to desired color scheme]`"
For a fixed installation, I recommend to copy etc/dir_colors or its files
to /etc or to $DEFAULTS or to ~/.config or ~/.dir_colors
and to use the dircolors-mv wrapper mentioned below

The scripts (in bin) are:

256colors: A small perl script which just display 256 colors on capable
terminals in a systematic manner. The usage should be self-explaining.

dircolors-mv: This script is a wrapper for dircolors.
If you copy this script into your path you can use
	eval "`dircolors-mv`"
if you followed the above suggestion about the location.
This will pick the corresponding file depending on the environment variables
TERM (to determine whether the terminal is 8-bit capable by a heuristics),
SOLARIZED (to determine whether output for solarized is desired), and
DEFAULTS (for the path mentioned above).
If the heuristics for the terminal does not work for you, just export TERM
locally, e.g.
	eval "`TERM=xterm-256colors dircolors-mv`"
will force a 256 color scheme.
