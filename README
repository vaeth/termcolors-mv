256colors sample script and dircolors configuration for standard or 256 colors.
The dircolors configuration is suitable e.g. for black background.

For gentoo, the package is available over the mv overlay (via layman).

To use the colors you have to call
	eval "`dircolors [path to your install dir]/etc/DIR_COLORS-256`"
or
	eval "`dircolors [path to your install dir]/etc/DIR_COLORS`"
respectively (e.g. in you shell initialization script).
For zsh, this is done if you use
	https://github.com/vaeth/zshrc-mv/
(which you can also install from the mv overlay).
